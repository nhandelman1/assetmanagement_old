<h1>Conventions</h1>

<h2>Docstrings and Type Hints</h2>
Use Google Python Style guide. Put type hints in docstring where code
linking works. Put type hints in the code where code linking does not 
work.

<h2>Imports</h2>
Follow PEP 8.  

Standard library imports.  
Blank Line.  
Related third party imports.  
Blank Line.  
Local application/library specific imports.

Within each group, put from statements before import statements. 
Relative imports before absolute imports. dot has higher precedence 
than alphabet characters (dot before alphabet characters when reading
from top to bottom)
